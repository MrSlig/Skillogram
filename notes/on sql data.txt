	1) id
	2) login (check size, current is 32 char)
	3) salt (check size & make salt double: php file + sql row; current size is 32 char)
	4) password (check size with double salt; current size is 128 char)
	5) avatar (u don't need one, just save avatar like <user_id_dir/unixTime.MIME & rewrite last used avatar. Also, make shure u stash only 5 last used 
		avatars & check their size in px & bytes)
^^ Also check sql options on rows data, it's kind of interesting...
